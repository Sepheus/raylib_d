*   raylib easings (header only file)
*
*   Useful easing functions for values animation
*
*   This header uses:
*       #define EASINGS_STATIC_INLINE       // Inlines all functions code, so it runs faster.
*                                           // This requires lots of memory on system.
*   How to use:
*   The four inputs t,b,c,d are defined as follows:
*   t = current time (in any unit measure, but same unit as duration)
*   b = starting value to interpolate
*   c = the total change in value of b that needs to occur
*   d = total time it should take to complete (duration)
*
*   Example:
*
*   int currentTime = 0;
*   int duration = 100;
*   float startPositionX = 0.0f;
*   float finalPositionX = 30.0f;
*   float currentPositionX = startPositionX;
*
*   while (currentPositionX < finalPositionX)
*   {
*       currentPositionX = EaseSineIn(currentTime, startPositionX, finalPositionX - startPositionX, duration);
*       currentTime++;
*   }
